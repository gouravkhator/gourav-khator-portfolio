# Portfolio Website

A portfolio, centering my past **achievements**, my present **passions**, and my future **_endeavors_**.

## Checklist for Implementation

- [x] Skills Section

- [ ] Change the text after "I'm Gourav" dynamically with characters getting deleted and then inserted with other text like "a Passionate Systems Programmer".
- [ ] Experiences Section

  - Use Lit Element for this blogs section, if possible.

## Current Bugs

- [ ] Header/Nav sidebar is not visible fully, if the max height of the screen goes lower than 615px. And its nav width is 220px, which should also be responsive.
- [x] Project description gets cut somehow in the width of 260px around.
- [ ] Above 1200px width, the space for the header is left out weirdly in the left side of the page.
- [ ] The text in the `header > nav > ul.nav-pages > li` is overflowing outside its parent for some of the nav sections.
- [ ] Body does not fill full height of main element so, I think it slows rendering and does cumulative layout shifts for some elements.
